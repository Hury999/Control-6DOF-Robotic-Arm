# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm-Control
Controlling the 6DOF robotic arm in various ways

### Idea
The idea of this project is to enable people to familiarise themselves with robotic arms and robotics in general. The project contains programs and software which together enable users to use a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF). The controlling arm is realized with a microcontroller coupled with serial communication to PC and Android devices. 

### Control program on the microcontroller
The control program for the robotic arm is written in Arduino with several additional libraries enabling multithreading and controlling servo motors.

### Control Software
Control software is written for Windows, Android, and 3D Program Blender. Software for Windows is written in C# using Windows Forms. For Android, MIT App Inventor used as a Rapid Application Development Methodology so that way saving time in developing prototype applications.
The program for Blender is written in Python as Blender script.
